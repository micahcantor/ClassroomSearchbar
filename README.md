# Installation Guide
I'm still working on getting the extension published to the Chrome Web Store, so for now you will have to upload it to your browser manually. 
Here's how to do it:

1. **Clone/Download** this repo to your computer. 
2. Go to **chrome://extensions** and turn on **Developer Mode** in the top right.
3. Click **Load Unpacked**, navigate to the folder you downloaded, and upload it.
4. Go to a Google Classroom page and use the search bar. The first time it will ask you to sign into Google for permission to read your Classroom data.
5. That's it! You should only have to sign in once per account.
